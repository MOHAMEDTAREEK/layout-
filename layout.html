                <h4>As for the CSS, most of it's fairly ordinary except for the uses of the display property. The <form>, <div>s, and <label>s and <input>s have been told to display like a table, table rows, and table cells respectively. Basically, they'll act like HTML table markup, causing the labels and inputs to line up nicely by default. All we then have to do is add a bit of sizing, margin, etc., to make everything look a bit nicer and we're done.

You'll notice that the caption paragraph has been given display: table-caption;, which makes it act like a table <caption>, and caption-side: bottom; to tell the caption to sit on the bottom of the table for styling purposes, even though the markup is before the <input> elements in the source. This allows for a nice bit of flexibility.</h4>
